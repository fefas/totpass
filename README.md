# Fast TOTP

This project aims to provide a command line interface (CLI) for Time-Based
One-Time Passwords.

## Why?

I am tired to waste time to get the phone and open the application that stores
my two-factor-auth codes every time I need to login. A command line would be
pretty much faster and simpler.
